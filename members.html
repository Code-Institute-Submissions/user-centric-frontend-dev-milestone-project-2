                        <h3>Dave Brubeck</h3>
                        <h4>1951 - 2012</h4>
                        <img class="" src="assets/images/tab-images/dave.png">
                        <p>David Warren Brubeck (/ˈbruːbɛk/; December 6, 1920 – December 5, 2012) was an American jazz pianist and composer, considered one of the foremost 
                        exponents of cool jazz. Many of his compositions have become jazz standards including "In Your Own Sweet Way" and "The Duke". Brubeck's style ranged from 
                        refined to bombastic, reflecting both his mother's classical training and his own improvisational skills. His music is known for employing unusual time signatures 
                        as well as superimposing contrasting rhythms, meters, and tonalities. Brubeck experimented with time signatures throughout his career, recording "Pick Up Sticks" in 6/4, 
                        "Unsquare Dance" in 7/4, "World's Fair" in 13/4, and "Blue Rondo à la Turk" in 9/8. He was also a composer of orchestral and sacred music and wrote soundtracks for television, such as Mr. Broadway and the animated miniseries This Is America, Charlie Brown.
                        Often incorrectly attributed to Brubeck, the song "Take Five", which has become a jazz standard, was composed by Brubeck's long-time musical partner, alto saxophonist Paul Desmond.
                        Appearing on one of the top-selling jazz albums, Time Out, and written in 5/4 time, "Take Five" has endured as a jazz classic associated with Brubeck.

                        <p>Paul Desmond (born Paul Emil Breitenfeld, November 25, 1924 – May 30, 1977) was an American jazz alto saxophonist and composer, best known for 
                            his work with the Dave Brubeck Quartet and for composing that group's biggest hit, "Take Five". He was one of the most popular musicians to come out of the cool jazz scene.
                            In addition to his work with Brubeck, he led several groups and collaborated with Gerry Mulligan, Chet Baker, Jim Hall, and Ed Bickert. After years of chain smoking and 
                            poor health, Desmond succumbed to lung cancer in 1977 after a tour with Brubeck.

                        <p>Bob Bates (September 1, 1923 – September 13, 1981) was an American jazz bassist. Bates was born in Pocatello, Idaho. His mother was an organist, 
                        while his brother is the bassist Norman Bates. As a youth he played tuba, trumpet, and trombone. He then studied classical bass from 1944 to 1948 and 
                        played with Sonny Dunham in 1947 and with Jack Fina from 1948 to 1949. His first recording session was in 1949 with the Jack Sheedy's dixieland band. 
                        Early in the 1950s he played in the Two Beaux & a Peep Trio. He is best remembered for playing bass with the Dave Brubeck Quartet between 1954 and 1955, 
                        after which time he was replaced by his brother Norman Bates, then Eugene Wright. He appears on the albums Jazz Goes to College, Dave Brubeck at Storyville: 1954, 
                        Brubeck Time, and Jazz: Red Hot and Cool. This was his last major engagement, as he disappears from recording after the middle of the 1950s. He died in 1981 in San Francisco, 
                        California, at the age of 58.

                        <p>Joe Dodge (February 9, 1922 – August 18, 2004) was an American jazz musician. A subtle and creative drummer, Dodge will probably always be 
                        better known for his role primarily as a timekeeper and accompanist who set a standard for blending propulsive swing, creating an adaptability 
                        that allowed him to remain in the background and not interfere with the soloist's line extended to a reluctance to take drum solos.Born in Monroe, 
                        Wisconsin, Dodge was raised and grew up in San Francisco, California.[1] Dodge initially studied to be a symphonic percussionist, but like many 
                        young drummers of his generation, he was primarily influenced by Gene Krupa[1] and later listened Jo Jones, Jimmy Crawford and Shelly Manne,
                         different sources of inspiration that helped him to create his own creative style. During World War II, Dodge fulfilled his military duties from 1942 until 1945.
                          While serving, he played drums in the Coast Artillery band, where he met tenor saxophonist Dave van Kriedt, who introduced him to Dave Brubeck and Paul Desmond. 
                          After demobilization in 1946, Dodge worked in several dixieland groups and dance bands around the Bay area.</p>

                        <p>Ron Crotty (December 31, 1929 – May 7, 2015), born Ronald O'Crotty, was an American jazz bassist. He became know in the late 1940s 
                        and early 1950s for work with pianists Dave Brubeck and Vince Guaraldi. Crotty played the violin and sang as a child in the church choir. 
                        When the school orchestra needed a bass player, he started to master this instrument. He was gripped by the bebop and went to San Francisco 
                        State University to teach. He played in a bebop band with, among others, Al Molina and met Cal Tjader , who later recommended him to Dave Brubeck 
                        when the pianist wanted to start a trio. His work at Brubeck was interrupted by his military service. After two years, Crotty returned to Brubeck, 
                        now in his quartet with Paul Desmond and Lloyd Daviswhich became famous with the album Jazz at Oberlin (1953). After a year, he left Brubeck due to 
                        hepatitis and returned to San Francisco after years of touring, where his music career was ruined by alcohol and amphetamine addiction. During his time
                         in San Francisco, he performed with pianist Vince Guaraldi and guitarist Eddie Duran and appeared as the Ron Crotty Trio on Modern Music from San Francisco (1956).
                        Crotty also worked odd jobs on the side to supplement his income. He finally beat his addictions in 1997. Crotty has regularly played in the Oakland Museum café for 
                        years, including with trombonist Frank Phipps. He also has his own group, Ron Crotty & Friends, with which he performed in San Francisco and the surrounding area. 
                        A trio album with Phipps and Tony Corman was released in 2009.

                        <p>Joseph Albert Morello (July 17, 1928 – March 12, 2011) was a jazz drummer best known for his work with the Dave Brubeck Quartet. 
                        He was particularly noted for playing in the unusual time signatures employed by that group in such pieces as "Take Five" and "Blue Rondo à la Turk". 
                        Popular for its work on college campuses during the 1950s, Brubeck's group reached new heights with Morello. In June 1959, Morello participated in a 
                        recording session with the quartet—completed by the alto saxophonist Paul Desmond and the bassist Eugene Wright—that yielded "Kathy's Waltz" and 
                        "Three to Get Ready", both of which intermingled 3/4 and 4/4 time signatures.

                            Bates was the brother of Bob Bates. He played in Jimmy Dorsey's band in 1945-46 and with Raymond Scott and Carmen Cavallaro 
                            shortly thereafter. In 1948 he played in a trio with Dave Brubeck, and in 1949 with Paul Desmond. He recorded with Jack Sheedy's 
                            Dixieland Jazz Band in 1950. After spending four years in the Air Force, Bates played with Wally Rose's Dixieland Band in 1955 and 
                            then replaced his brother Bob Bates in Brubeck's quartet, playing on multiple albums from Dave Brubeck and Jay & Kai at Newport (1956) onwards.
                             He also recorded with Desmond's group again in 1956. In 1957 he left Brubeck, and led a trio in San Francisco.

                          of cool jazz—Mulligan was also a significant arranger, working with Claude Thornhill, Miles Davis, Stan Kenton, and others. 
                          His pianoless quartet of the early 1950s with trumpeter Chet Baker is still regarded as one of the best cool jazz groups. Mulligan was
                           also a skilled pianist and played several other reed instruments. Several of his compositions, such as "Walkin' Shoes" and "Five Brothers",

                          and also played with Tal Farlow during this time. In the 1970s he worked with Illinois Jacquet and Jay McShann, among others. He directed musical events at a
